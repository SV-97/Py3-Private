## Repository for learning Python, various small programs and snippets
Please keep in mind that this code isn't necessarily good, but rather a quick solution to a problem I wanted to tackle or something I wanted to try. For higher quality code, stuff like TUInventory is probably the better reference.

000     - Number guess game  
001     - Calculate faculty of a number  
002     - Read a file that's a dictionary to two languages and get translation to input  
003     - Create a dictionary to two languages  
004     - First tests with numpy, matplotlib and timeit  
004*    - Plotting of various functions  
005     - Implementation of Bubble Sort  
006     - Implementation of Selection Sort  
007     - Implementation of Insertion Sort  
008     - Implementation of Merge Sort  
009     - Interface with batch to get latency of connection with remote server and plot it time domain in a live plot  
010     - Deployed version independent of Python - Program to calculate voltage divider circuits for reference voltages and find standart series resistors to build the circuit with  
~~011     - Calculating some mechanical stresses~~  
012     - Implementation of the dice minigame from kingdom come deliverance  
013     - Basic server that listens on a port, sends and receives data - First contact with sockets  
~~014     - Network implementation of 012 - not working as of now~~  
~~015     - Tried around with combining C and Python, ditched it because I noticed I did in fact not need it at that point~~  
016     - Tested stuff with periodic functions for iphipy  
017     - Implemented a custom iterator and generator  
018     - Compared speed between using a custom iterator and a comprehension  
019     - Find frequency of f(x)=g(x)+h(x) where g and h are periodic functions  
020     - Bruteforce Solution to a Math Puzzle: ["SEND + MORE = MONEY. An Amazing Puzzle - Can You Solve It?" by MindYourDecisions](https://youtu.be/p5YjV-100Hc)  
021     - Speed comparison of two ways to get unique elements from a list  
022     - Some functools and contextlib stuff  
023     - A body of mine and I wanted to compare the effects of black powder and smokeless powder on the action of a gun  
024     - Simple utility to validate a file via a given hash  
025     - Password generator and simple password manager  
026     - Program that modifies it's sourcecode on execution  
027     - Speed comparison between parallel solution with varying number of processes vs. linear. Also function to "denoise" data and split workload evenly between processes  
028     - Reply to a guy on stackoverflow that wanted to create new files with ascending numbers in the files names  
029     - Simple histogram in reply to guy on stackoverflow  
030     - Seperate (can't recall if improved) version of the denoise function from 027  
031     - Reply to guy on stackoverflow to find last line of a file  
032     - Very simple Cython example  
033     - Implementation of Sieve of Eratosthenes for Cython  
034     - Needed a test database to study some SQL  
035     - Trying pickle  
036     - First verion of a barcode reader, now in seperate repository  
037     - Take a photo via webcam  
038     - Barcode Reader second version, now in seperate repository  
039     - Simple tikinter app  
040     - Original "deployment"(release?) version of the Barcode Reader, now in seperate repository  
041     - Had the fun idea of rebuilding a picture from text. Area in original picture is condensed into it's average and depending on the value of that average text is written to the output  
042     - Adapters and converters for custom classes for sqlite3  
043     - Buddy of mine uses Ansys alot and there's alot of stuff in it he can't have in the file for further processing so I automated it  
044     - Just copied from a book of mine to try it out  
045     - Class I proposed for CPython stdlib (extension of threading.Timer)  
046     - Server that listens on UDP for some messages  
047     - Small chat based on a TCP connection  
048     - Test with Django, adaption from book  
049     - How to use a generator as a consumer  
050     - Using composite simpsons to approximate the integral of a function - also see the C++ (https://github.com/JoshuaSimon/Numerical-Integration) and rust (https://github.com/SV-97/Rust/tree/master/R_004_NumericIntegration) implementation. Rust actually ran faster than C++ with the tested values, with Python expectedly clocking in at an order of magnitude more.  
051     - Solver for systems of linear equations using Gaussian elimination (and various other linear algebra functions that I thought I needed but ultimately didn't use)  
052     - Just played around a bit with sorting the pixels of an image  
053     - Pure Python Discrete Fast Fourier Transform  
054     - May do this at some point: Access the class a function is defined on  
055     - WIP: Pure Python implementation of SHA-256 just to test a few things. Also incorporates a class to easier manipulate bitwise data(Without using the bitstring module)  
056     - Speed comparison of using a for loop, list comprehension or map in cases where they're purely used for side effects rather than producing a list  
057     - Draws Voronoi diagrams for given points  
058     - I think this was a problem someone on stack overflow had and my solution to it?  
059     - An example module for how to extend python with rust  
060     - Currently reading a bit on ANNs and came across the McCulloch/Pitts Neuronmodel and tried my hand at implementing it. Also wrote a small description language to generate the neuron-structure and graphviz-dot-graphs that visualize this structure.
